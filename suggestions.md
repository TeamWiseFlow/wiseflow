# Wiseflow Project Analysis & Strategic Enhancement Blueprint

## Executive Summary

Wiseflow is an AI-powered information extraction system designed to mine relevant information from various sources based on user-defined focus points. It employs a "wide search" approach for broad information collection rather than "deep search" for specific questions. The system uses large language models (LLMs) to analyze content, extract relevant information, and generate insights.

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Wiseflow project, including its functional capabilities, architectural design, and strategic enhancement opportunities. The analysis is based on a thorough code review and examination of the project's documentation.
