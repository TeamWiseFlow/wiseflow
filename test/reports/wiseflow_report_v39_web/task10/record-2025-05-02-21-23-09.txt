Spring AI is a project aimed at simplifying the development of AI applications without unnecessary complexity. It is an experimental project that uses Spring framework concepts to create AI applications, integrating Azure OpenAI and OpenAI as backends. It supports use cases such as content generation, code generation, semantic search, and summarization. Spring AI provides an abstraction layer built on top of Python libraries like LangChain and LlamaIndex to simplify switching between different Java client APIs. It offers features like a unified API for AI model integration, prompt templates for interacting with AI models, support for chaining calls to solve complex problems, output parsing to convert outputs into CSV or JSON formats, learning specific dialogue styles, and testing to maintain project quality. The project is inspired by Python projects like LangChain and LlamaIndex but is not a direct port. It aims to make AI applications accessible to developers using various programming languages, not just Python. Spring AI's core is to provide abstractions that form the foundation for developing AI applications, with implementations that can be easily swapped with minimal code changes. It also integrates with other Spring projects like Spring Integration, Spring Batch, and Spring Data as use case complexity increases. The project supports models that process and generate information, typically mimicking human cognitive functions, and provides concepts like prompts, prompt templates, tokens, output parsing, chaining calls, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance AI model responses. It also offers configuration options for OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Ollama, and HuggingFace. The relationship with deepseek is not mentioned in the provided text.
