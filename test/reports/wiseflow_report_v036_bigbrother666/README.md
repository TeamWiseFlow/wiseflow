by bigbrother666

## summary

- task number: 4
- sample number: 6
- involved models: ['Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct', 'Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct', 'deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V2.5', 'Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct']
- model provider: siliconflow api

## conclusion

- If your source pages are relatively simple with small amounts of information per page, considering cost and time (mainly time), Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct is recommended

    *Although Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct appears to have high total deductions, this mainly occurs in list selection. For pure article content extraction, its performance is very good, even better than DeepSeek-V2.5*

- If your source pages contain more links, have complex layouts, and you don't want to miss any information, DeepSeek-V2.5 is recommended

- Scores represent the number of times the output deviated from human expectations, including omissions, extraction errors, and not_so_good
- for omissions and errors, one time is one point; for not_so_good, one time is 0.5 point; lower scores mean better.
- Cost unit is Ôø•, all evaluations use siliconflow api, according to siliconflow official pricing.
