1. Customer reviews for the Samsung 990 PRO SSD highlight both strengths and areas for improvement. **Pros** include exceptional speed (up to 7,450 MB/s sequential read), reliability, compatibility with PS5 and high-performance PCs, and effective performance with encryption. Users praise its thermal management, ease of use with Samsung Magician Software, and suitability for gaming, AI workloads, and large file transfers. **Cons** mentioned are packaging issues (e.g., damaged during shipping), compatibility challenges with specific hardware (e.g., Alienware X17 R1 requiring a custom heatsink), difficulties cloning the drive for OS backups, and the need for a separate heatsink in some cases. Some users noted that while the drive excels in data storage, it may not be ideal for boot OS installations due to cloning limitations. Overall, the product is highly recommended for its performance but requires attention to thermal solutions and compatibility checks.

1. The customer reviews for the Samsung 990 EVO Plus (not the PRO variant) highlight **pros** such as blazing speed, reliability, quiet operation, and future-proof PCIe 4.0 compatibility. Users noted significantly faster boot times, program launches, and file transfers compared to older models like the 970 EVO Plus. The drive’s efficient cooling and Samsung Magician software for monitoring/optimization were also praised. **Cons** mentioned include the DRAMless design (potentially affecting longevity for heavy workloads) and reduced performance on older PCIe 3.0 motherboards (e.g., write speeds of ~2910 MB/s vs. 1973 MB/s on PCIe 3.0). However, no direct reviews for the **Samsung 990 PRO SSD** were found in the main-content area.
