# wiseflow backend api

- http api: [HTTP_API.md](HTTP_API.md)
- websocket api: [WS_API.md](WS_API.md)

The HTTP API is used for data reading/writing and configuration management, while the WebSocket API is used for real-time push of task statuses, error messages, etc. (essentially serving as a user interaction messaging system).
